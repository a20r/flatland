Dimensionality reduction is a key component of making robotic motion planning fast and efficient. A rigid body has six degrees of freedom (DoF), so a multi-link robot such as a humanoid or snake robot can have dozens or hundreds of DoF. The rotational and translational transformations of a rigid body can be described with the 3-dimensional Special Euclidean group (known as SE(3)). SE(3) is homeomorphic to the topological space R3xRP3 (where RP3 is the 3-dimensional real projective plane). Therefore it is easy to imagine a multi-link robot with an arbitrarily complex state space. The picture is further complicated by the addition of obstacles into a robot's world. The state space for motion planning, which must take into account both the robot and obstacles, is called the configuration space. 

The high dimensionality of the configuration space of complex robots means that motion planning for many robots is slow or infeasible. This is because of the "curse of dimensionality", in which the size of the search space increases exponentially with the dimension. One way to speed up motion planning is to reduce the number of dimensions in your search. For this project, we tested the performance of a number of dimensionality reduction techniques to see which one was the most effective in speeding up motion planning while providing reliable obstacle avoidance.
